# :paintbrush: HTML Canvas
Experimenting with HTML Canvas. I used trigonometry to draw an animated pattern on a canvas that responds to window resizing. The canvas interacts with mouse position, scaling and manipulating the pattern.

Warning: This animation can cause performance issues - use with caution. Video example provided below.

Performance Facts I learned: Multiplication is more efficient than division. Square root requires a large amount of processing power.
